# Optimizing-Loan-Approvals

Machine learning and data science techniques can be implemented to a variety of industries to
optimize processes and achieve more accurate results. Loan approvals for clients is a time
consuming process that requires bank managers to determine the creditability of the applicant,
which is subject to the biases of the reviewer. Our team was approached by bank managers
interested in developing a data analytics based strategy to analyze credit card data and determine
the credit risk. The original dataset contained 20 attributes with 1000 observations, and the
corresponding class attribute, credibility, or credit risk of prospective clients. Within the scope of
this project, we examined the German credit card data set and built two machine learning
models, a decision tree and a Naïve Bayes classifier. For comparison purposes, both models were
built with the inclusion of all the features, as well as with selected features through the
implementation of subject matter expertise and bidirectional elimination. The overarching goals
of these processes were to determine patterns in the data, predict which applications have good
or bad credit risk, optimize the loan approval procedure and provide statistical significance in the
accuracy of the algorithms. The findings of the models determined that with feature selection,
the Naïve Bayes classifier outperforms the decision tree by 6%, with an accuracy of 78%. We
recommend that the client utilizes the filtered data with the Naïve Bayes classifier for accurate
and impartial decision making.
